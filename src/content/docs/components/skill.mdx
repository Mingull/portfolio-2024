The `Skill` component is a simple React component that can be used to display a skill with a progress bar. It takes two props: `name` and `level`. The `name` prop is a string that represents the name of the skill, and the `level` prop is a number that represents the level of the skill. The `Skill` component uses the `Framer Motion` library to create a smooth animation for the progress bar.
